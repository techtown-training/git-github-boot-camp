# Config

Check your current config first (your config may vary):

![Git config](../../img/git-config-1.png)

You can also get a specific configuration value:

![Git config get](../../img/git-config-2.png)

Let's set our username and email:

![Set username and email](../../img/git-config-3.png)

You could potentially also set it for just this repository 
by omitting the `--global` flag.
